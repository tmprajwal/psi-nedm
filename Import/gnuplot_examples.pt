#GNUPlot: Plot time spectra [or QDC] for all cycles
$plot "test.txt" matrix every 1::6 with linespoint
#... 1::6, here 1 indicates interval and 1 implies all values get read, if 2 is used every other value is plotted
#...1::6, here 6 indicates that the array (time spectra or QDC spectra) begins at position (0,1,2...) 6.
#GNUPlot: Plot time [or QDC] spectra for specific cycles
$plot "test.txt" matrix every :3:2 with linespoint
#...:3:2, here 3 indicates starting column, i.e. only the (1,2) 3rd cycle and beyond will be plotted
#...:3:2, here 2 indicates that the array (time spectra or QDC spectra) begins at position (0,1) 2.
#With more combinations, you can select any cycle or start point as per your wish.
