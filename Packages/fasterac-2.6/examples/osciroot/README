        Statistics on Faster Oscillos with fasterac & root

  ---------------------------------------------------------------




  Requirements
  ------------
    Root & fasterac are installed.




  Content
  -------

    rootlogon.C
      Is run whenever you start root, initializes everything :
        - define fasterac include path and load libfasterac,
        - compile and load the following macros.


    load_fasterac.C
      Is a root macro used to declare fasterac includes and load libfasterac
      inside ROOT.
      See rootlogon.C :
            >
            >  gROOT->ProcessLine (".x load_fasterac.C");
            >


    Oscillo.C
      Is a storage class (branch tree) with commonly used features.


    oscillo_faster2tree.C
      Is a faster to root converter used to create a root tree containing an
      Oscillo branch.


    load_oscillo_tree.C
      Load a tree before using.


    oscillo_test.C
      Examples of how to display histograms directly from an Oscillo tree
      using the TTree methods SetAlias() and Draw().
      Very useful but slow with big files.

    TH_Osc_Explorer.C
      This Root Class is used to see oscillos selected from statistics.
      It displays at the same time :
        - an histogram (1 or 2D) showing statistics from oscillos.
        - the oscillograms involved in the selected bin of the histogram.
      Construct an 'explorer' by passing one Oscillo_Tree, one Oscillo and a
      function which performs the calculations of the statistics.
      See constructors in TH_Osc_Explorer.h and examples given :
        - baseline_explorer.C
        - satur_explorer.C
        - discri_explorer.C


    Discrillo.C
      This Root Class shows how to inherit Oscillo for specific purpose and
      to create an TH_Osc_Explorer using it (see also discri_explorer2.C).


    baseline_explorer.C & satur_explorer.C
      Examples to show how to use TH_Osc_Explorer for one dimension statistics.


    discri_explorer.C
      Example to show how to use TH_Osc_Explorer for two dimensions statistics.


    discrip_explorer2.C
      Example to show how to specialize Oscillo.C (see Discrillo.C) and
      how to use TH_Osc_Explorer with a child class of Oscillo.


    oscillo14_20k.fast
      Example data file to begin with OSCIROOT and try each macro


    clean.sh
      Script used to clean the directory (delete generated libraries)



  Beginning
  ---------
    Type 'root' in the console (in this directory).
    Look at rootlogon.C, there is three parts at the end of the file:
      - create a tree
      - load a tree
      - work with it
    The first time you will launch 'root', those 3 parts will be executed,
    creating the first oscillo_tree file, loading it and executing one of the
    examples of work.
    Once your oscillo_tree is created, comment the first part and try the other
    work examples (comment/uncomment the examples and retype 'root').



  Continuing
  ----------
    Copy the example files and modify your own macros to your needs ...
