 README : Fasterac reader example
----------------------------------


This example shows how to write and compile programs using Fasterac library.


Installation :
--------------
Both libfasterac and pkg-config have to be installed before compiling this
example. This can be checked by the command 'pkg-config --list-all', then
libfasterac should appear in the returned list. Without the pkg-config tool
installed, the Makefile has to be modified as indicated in it.

To compile and test this example : make && make test


reader_example.c :
------------------
This program is divided in two functions : main and data_display.
The main function shows how to read a data file sequentially, and data_display
how to handle every predefined data type.
