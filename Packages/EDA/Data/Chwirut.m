	"ChwirutData is data on ultrasonic calibration, taken by Daniel Chwirut
	in the 1970s at the National Institutes of Standards and
	Technology (NIST) in the U.S.A. The data format is {d, r}, where d
	is the metal distance and r is the ultrasonic response. The dataset
	is now part of the Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD) maintained
	by NIST at www.nist.gov/itl/div898/strd, where it is identified
	as \"chwirut2.\""
